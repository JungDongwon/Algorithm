# Problem: https://www.educative.io/courses/grokking-the-coding-interview/JQMAmrVPL7l

# Solution: 

from heapq import *

class Meeting:
  def __init__(self, start, end):
    self.start = start
    self.end = end

  def __lt__(self, other):
    # min heap based on meeting.end
    return self.end < other.end


def min_meeting_rooms(meetings):
  # sort the meetings by start time
  meetings.sort(key=lambda x: x.start)

  minRooms = 0
  minHeap = []
  for meeting in meetings:
    # remove all the meetings that have ended
    while(len(minHeap) > 0 and meeting.start >= minHeap[0].end):
      heappop(minHeap)
    # add the current meeting into min_heap
    heappush(minHeap, meeting)
    # all active meetings are in the min_heap, so we need rooms for all of them.
    minRooms = max(minRooms, len(minHeap))
  return minRooms
