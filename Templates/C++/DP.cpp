// How to determine it is a Dynamic Programming problems
// 1. The problem will ask for the optimum value (maximum or minimum) of something
// 2. Future "decisions" depend on earlier decisions. If it isn't, it can be an greedy algorithm.
// ** When trying to decide if the second characteristic is applicable, 
//    assume it isn't, then try to think of a counterexample that proves a greedy algorithm won't work. **
